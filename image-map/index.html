		<p>I've been a fan of the Nissan brand for a long time. Growing up, my Dad had an old Nissan Titan that he'd drive me aorund in.
		That truck went over 190,000 miles without any major issues. At that point, he sold it and for all we know it could still be driving 
		around with no issues today.<br>
		Now, I drive a 2007 Nissan Frontier. The truck was cheap which was definitely a big motivator for me to buy it, especially with as few
		miles that it had. It's been great at handling the snow as well. I've gone through two winters with it without any issues now.<br>
		I remember as a kid, I was a big fan of the famous Nissan Skyline GT-R's. I had a litte model version of one that I'd play around with.
		The old Fast n' Furious movies had them, which always peaked my imagination. Sadly, my Frontier does not drive like a Nissan GT-R.</p>
