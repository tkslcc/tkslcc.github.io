		<h2>Here are videos from this week's X Games Big Air snowboarding competition:</h2>
		<p>The 2020 X Games were just held in Aspen, Colorado. Many varied events were held for both genders. Some new rules have been put in place that allow for more runs to be
		put down in a given competition. I've been following the X Games for some time now and was really excited to see the new ruleset put to use. Everytime I show someone who doesn't
		watch Snowboarding/Skiing clips from the X Games, it typically comes with a bit of a wow factor. That's why I thought it would be a nice thing to put into my web page.</p>
